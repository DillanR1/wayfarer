Wayfarer Project Questions:

What does the blank search bar do in the bottom left corner? Next to Wayfarer header.

Is there a theme, Style or background color?

Is there a a specific border, padding and margin that we should use between elements?

What kind of image goes next to the Wayfarer text in the picture box? A profile pic (headshot)? Any kind of pic for a profile pic?

In the top left quadrant, is the large image box supposed to be a carousel? If yes, are the pictures supposed to be of locations, people or both?

What are the three topics supposed to be about? Webpage (i.e. travel blog cool Locations) Like an Instagram of actual geographical locations? 

Can these locations be landmarks in nature or historic sites, or must they be cities?

What color is the navbar and buttons?

How wide is the navbar supposed to be? 

Do the Sign up/ Log in buttons take the user to the same large prompt or can it be splt? (It could be annoying to see the sign-up promt for existing users just trying to log in.)
