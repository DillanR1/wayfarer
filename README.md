# wayfarer

In this project, my group consisted of three developers; Timothy Allgood, Lucian Nicolescu, and myself (Dillan Roby).
Project Wayfarer simulated the relationship between developer team and client. The client was played by one of the instructors (an experienced developer), while our team built out features to show the client during our check-ins. The Check-ins could be performed at intervals of our choosing, with emphasis on avoiding assumptions in regard to the site's function and design. 

Where questions arose, we would try to set up a quick face-to-face meeting with our client. If the client proved to be unavailable or the question(s) were rather simple, we would message the client for any clarification. This project, like the others featured in my portfolio, was built in the time frame of about one week.



# The Site

The site has two models, one of which incorporates restful routing and full CRUD. The cities are populated via database and admin function. The posts for each corresponding city have full CRUD functionality. Users can sign up and log in as well. Auth was added so that a usernames and passwords must contain a minimum amount of characters, and no username may be used twice. The site also has an image upload feature so that users can add a profile picture. The site can also be switched to dark mode, via toggle switch in the settings menu.



# Methodology

We decided that one of the best ways to complete this project was to utilize pair programming principles, except with an extra developer navigating. This approach allowed for a good work-flow. 



# Technologies

This travel themed site was built with Python, PostgreSQL and Django.

# Thanks!

Thank you to my team mates, Lucian Nicolescu and Timothy Allgood for guiding me through some of the trickier bits, and helping me to contribute in a meaningful way.

Special Thanks to Timothy Allgood for deploying wayfarer to Heroku!
